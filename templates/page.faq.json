Can you imagine hand-making, dying, and embroidering a garment from scratch and having all the same details come out exactly the same each time? That is what makes our custom orders unique! Therefore, there might be some variation if patterned fabrics, borders, etc need to be sourced. Additionally, embroiderers may be unique to each order, which can cause slight variation in embroidery. Lastly, it is difficult to get each specific dye job exactly the same for each batch. However, we always try our best to get as close to original details as possible. Ordering pieces with this type of special hand touch causes factors noted above to be out of our control, but makes each piece unique. None of our styles are factory made.</p>"

Therefore, it is extremely important to send the accurate measurements. Measurements should be provided in Inches.</p><p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Below are some general guidelines for taking the measurements with higher accuracy:</span></p><p>* Wear regular bra (not a sports bra) while taking measurements </p><p>* Have a trusted tailor take your measurements</p><p>* If taking measurements at home, stand in front of the mirror (so you too can monitor the process) or ask someone for help.</p><p>* While taking measurements, stand straight, have arms hang loose on the side, and do not suck in your stomach</p><p>* Measurements should be taken snuggly over the body, not too tight or too loose</p><p>* Please ensure length measurements take into account any shoes or heels</p><p>* Tip: to use your existing clothing as guides for measurements. For example, if you’re providing measurements for a saree blouse, then we suggest wearing saree blouse that fits well to cross-check. For skirt lengths, check measurements against an existing skirt and so forth</p><p>If your measurement details are accurate, this will reflect on the final fit of your outfit.</p>"
